# Next Bus Bot (WIP)

Discord Bot that lets users schedule notifications with bus times from the [NextBus API](https://gist.github.com/grantland/7cf4097dd9cdf0dfed14). Discord Bot uses MongoDB to manage the scheduled notifications.

The bot works for any bus system that uses NextBus to provide time predictions. You can add the bot to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=454489707360026626&scope=bot). 

The bot might be on and off while I take it down to add features and test.

## Commands

The bot currently only takes commands in private messages.

### /start
The bot will give you basic information on itself.

### /add
The bot will give you prompts to configure a notification.

# TODO

- Let users edit and delete notifications

- Ability to set notifications to weekdays only

- Improve readability

- Add some general features
